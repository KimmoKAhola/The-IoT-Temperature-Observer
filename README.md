# The-Plant-Observer
An IoT project for the course 24ST - 1DT305 at LNU (https://lnu-ftk.instructure.com/courses/402).

Current implementation: one microcontroller that reads values from different sensors and saves to a database. A telegram bot is connected to this microcontroller and users can, if they want to, request selected live data from the microcontroller.

Future ideas: implement more sensors and create a smart home.

# Introduction - tutorial on how to....

# Objective

I want to create a sensor network. This is a tutorial to build the first sensor and save information to a database
