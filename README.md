# Introduction

This repository serves as the code base for an IoT project for the summer course 24ST - 1DT305 at [LNU](https://lnu-ftk.instructure.com/courses/402).
The purpose of this project has been to create a simple endpoint that I can place somewhere and have it collect data. Users can interact with this controller by using a telegram bot and writing certain commands to it.

The future goals of this project is to build my own database and api services by combining the microcontrollers with .net APIs (I study to become a .NET Developer) and as such this codebase contains free to use code for .NET services as well. This will later be used to implement my own smart home (I hope).

Since this course is a beginner course aimed to teach microcontrollers/IoT and python the focus of this report will be on those parts. Links to tools used for the .NET code will be provided and simple python snippets on how to send data to these services will also be shown. The C# code and database design will however not be covered at all but feel free to contact me in swedish or english if you want more information.

The telegram bot code will also be kept beginner friendly and utilize HTTP requests to fetch/send data. This is not a scalable solution but will work fine for personal use.

Time required to implement this project yourself: 6-10 hours depending on experience (for the python part).

# Setup

To connect your raspberry pi pico wh to your computer and upload code to it the following editors are recommended.

| Editor | Pros/Cons |
| :--- | :---|
| [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) | Used in this project. It is very extensible but can be overwhelming for a beginner. |
| [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) | Very beginner friendly and lightweight. Lacks a lot of features that VS Code has. |

If VS Code is used the Pymakr plugin has to be installed as well.
[Pymakr](https://docs.pycom.io/gettingstarted/software/vscode/)

Firmware for micropython can be found here. Put this on your microcontroller by pressing the BOOTSEL button while connecting the controller to a computer.
[MicroPython Firmware](https://micropython.org/download/)

### How to upload code to the microcontroller

## VS Code instructions

1. Install the pymakr extension
<p align="center">
      <img src="https://kimmoprojectstorage.blob.core.windows.net/lnu-tutorial/pymakr-install.png">
</p>

2. Connect to your plugged in device
<p align="center">
      <img src="https://kimmoprojectstorage.blob.core.windows.net/lnu-tutorial/vscode-connect.png">
</p>

3. Select the .py file you wish to upload

</p>

## Thonny instructions

### Will be implemented soon.

## How to setup your telegram bot

To get your own telegram bot, please click on this link and follow the instructions: https://telegram.me/BotFather.

It will look something like this
<p align="center">
      <img src="https://kimmoprojectstorage.blob.core.windows.net/lnu-tutorial/telegram-bot-instructions.png" alt="telegram-bot-instructions">
</p>

1. Click on the link you received from the bot to open the bot chat and interact with it.
2. Store the api key you received from the Botfather in your .env file and keep it secret.
3. You now have your own telegram bot to send notifications to yourself and your friends!
4. See the code section to get a code snippet you can use to get started.

## Tools needed to implement the .NET API

If you want to implement the .net code in the repository I recommend using the Jetbrains Rider IDE or Visual Studio Community edition. 
     
| IDE | Free? |
| :---| :--- |
| [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) | Paid product or free educational license |
| [Visual Studio Community edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) | Yes |
| [VS Code C# instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/csharp) | Yes, but I do not recommend VS Code for this purpose. |

Entity Framework Core has been used as the ORM of choice and SQL Server is the selected database provider. You will need to install the relevant nuget packages.

# Connectivity

- [ ] How often is the data sent?
## Currently everything is written as a continuous loop without any asynchronous methods. A simple sleep delay of 10 seconds is used in the main loop. With all the delays of saving/fetching from api and database this turns out to be 2-3 calls per minute.
- [ ] Which wireless protocols did you use (WiFi, LoRa, etc ‚Ä¶)?
## WIFI. Why? 100 % uptime, fast response time etc.
cons: needlessly high resolution. Currently 2-3 datapoints are saved per minutes which is unneccessarily high. This will be changed in the future.
- [ ] Which transport protocols were used (MQTT, webhook, etc ‚Ä¶)
## webhook? HTTP requests, post, get, patch
- [ ] *Elaborate on the design choices regarding data transmission and wireless protocols. That is how your choices affect the device range and battery consumption.

# Data Visualization/presentation

- [ ] Provide visual examples on how the dashboard looks. Pictures needed.

# CHANGE ME CHANGE ME CHANGE ME!!!
Dashboard: ![myimage-alt-tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KimmoKAhola/The-IoT-Temperature-Observer/master/pictures/lnu-dashboard.png)
- [ ] How often is data saved in the database.
- [ ] *Explain your choice of database.
- [ ] *Automation/triggers of the data.
- [ ] Describe platform in terms of functionality
- [ ] *Explain and elaborate what made you choose this platform
Ubidots as well as Azure (free for 12 months if you are a student)

## Ubidots Dashboard
[Public Dashboard](https://stem.ubidots.com/app/dashboards/public/dashboard/QiS5cV6BLo26QOs3kU8ZUUYNLR0JPOHqLFPNH-FtdNE)

## Swagger API
This is an endpoint to fetch my saved sensor data. Use the GUI to click on the topmost option, /PlantData/Temperature, and click on execute to view the data. Note that some of the options are protected.
[API](https://plantobserverapi.azurewebsites.net/swagger/index.html)

You can also view this to get the JSON data directly [JSON](https://plantobserverapi.azurewebsites.net/PlantData/Temperature)

## Azure SQL server
Why azure? I study .net and it is very integrated with that tech stack. Also possible to use the service for free for up to 12 months if you apply for it with school email.
[Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/sv-se)

# Try it!
## Telegram chat bot
Interact with it if you want to and have a telegram account. If the microcontroller is live you will receive a response within 20 seconds.

This is an example of responses your bot might have.
